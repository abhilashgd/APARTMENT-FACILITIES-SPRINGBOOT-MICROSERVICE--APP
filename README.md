# amenity-reservation-system

An amenity reservation system where users/residents can log in and reserve a time to use a service such as fitness center, pool, or club house in an apartment complex. Each amenity will have a certain capacity (number of people that can use the service at the same time) so that people can make use of the amenities safely during the Covid-19 pandemic.
